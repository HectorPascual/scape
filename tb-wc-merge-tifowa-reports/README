mergeTifowaReports

MergeTifowaReports merges the single reports produced by tifowa or csv2Tifowa into
an overall summary report file.

During the run time of the Taverna component “MergeTifowaReports” in the "scanARC"
workflow, the tool is called twice. First to create the actual overall report in
csv format and secondly to create a report in Javascript/JSON format which is needed
as input for the graphical representation (see: "Workflow Setup - more details")
of the report.

Usage:
	java -jar mergeTifowaReports.jar [ReportDirectory] [OutputFile] [FormatOption]

	ReportDirectory	…	the directory containing the single tifowa report files
	OutputFile		…	the output file
	FormatOption	…	xls | csv | js
		xls	…	currently not used by the workflow 
		csv	…	this is the output the workflow uses for the full report
		js	…	this format is used as input for the graphical representation
