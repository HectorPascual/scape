Important notes for a quick start
---------------------------------

1) Install the underlying command line tool of the generic web service wrapper
   on your system.
   IMPORTANT: THE UNDERLYING COMMAND LINE TOOL FOR THE SERVICE SHOULD BE 
   INSTALLED IN A PATH WITHOUT WHITE SPACES. OTHERWISE A FULL PATH CALL TO THE
   COMMAND LINE TOOL WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY. 
2) Make sure the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Tomcat with the Axis2
   web application deployed, and Apache Ant are installed on your system. 

Below you will find more detailed instructions.

Requirements
------------

In order to run deploy the web service, you will need the Java SE Development Kit
(JDK) version 1.6.0 or higher, the underlying tool installed, a running
Apache Tomcat 6.0.18 Servlet Container (or another equivalent Servlet container)
with the Axis2 web application deployed.

- Underlying command line tool of this web service wrapper installed in a path
  without white spaces.

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK), JDK 6 Update 12 or higher
  Please download the Java SE SDK for your system at
  http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/.

- Apache Ant 1.7.0 or higher
  Please refer to the homepage at http://ant.apache.org and to the manual at
  http://ant.apache.org/manual/ for information on how to install Apache Ant.

- Apache Tomcat server Version 6.0.18 or higher
  Please download and install the Apache Tomcat Server 6.0.18 here
  http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi and follow the instructions
  of the RUNNING.txt in your apache tomcat directory. There you will also find
  the information on how to configure and start the apache tomcat server.

- Apache Axis2/Java Version 1.4.1 or higher
  Apache Axis is an implementation of the SOAP ("Simple Object Access Protocol")
  submission  to W3C. You only need the Web Application Archive (WAR) which
  must be deployed to your Tomcat web applications directory.
  http://ws.apache.org/axis2

Securing the Web Service
------------------------

Using the Apache2 webserver as frontend, you can configure the
HTTP-Authentication as follows (example for Linux):

1) Create a password file for a new user
       htpasswd -c /usr/local/apache2/pwds newuser
2) Configure access restriction in your httpd.conf, e.g. in
       /usr/local/apache2/httpd.conf
  restricting the access to the axis2 location (depends on the path):
    <Location /axis2>
        AuthName "only for registered users"
        AuthType Basic
        AuthUserFile "/usr/local/apache2/pwds"
        <Limit GET>
            require valid-user
        </Limit>
    </Location>

Also in the Apache Tomcat web server you can secure the web service
via basic HTTP-Authentication (example for Linux):

1) Configure the web.xml of the axis2 web application:
      /usr/local/java/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/web.xml
    and add the following:
      <web-app>
      â€¦
        <security-constraint>
          <web-resource-collection>
              <web-resource-name>secured services</web-resource-name>
              <url-pattern>/services/*</url-pattern>
          </web-resource-collection>
          <auth-constraint>
              <role-name>webservice</role-name>
          </auth-constraint>
        </security-constraint>
        <login-config>
          <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
          <realm-name>webservice</realm-name>
        </login-config>
     </web-app>

2) This requires the user "webservice" to be defined in the tomcat-users.xml:
       /usr/local/java/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/conf/tomcat-users.xml
    as follows:
       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8">
       <tomcat-users>
           <role rolename="webservice"/>
           <user username="tomcat" password="100%OCR" roles="webservice"/>
       </tomcat-users>

Note: In a productive environment the web service should be offered over SSH.

Logging
-------
For logging log4j is used for the demonstrator platform.
The client places logfiles in the project subdirectory "log".
If you want the service to log in the same directory, please adapt the
Axis2 configuration accordingly. Change the log4j properties in the file
    ${local.tomcat.base.dir}/${local.tomcat.axis.dir}/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
e.g.
    /usr/local/java/apache-tomcat-6.0.18/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties
You can indicate to create a log file:
    log4j.rootCategory=INFO, CONSOLE, LOGFILE
and specify the log file itself:
    log4j.appender.LOGFILE.File=log/project-service.log

Project structure
-----------------

- build
  This directory will only be created when the build task is executed. It
  contains generated sources, compiled classes, and resources. This
  directory can be deleted and will be recreated every time the ant build target
  is executed.
- doc
  Documentation and presentations. This directory will be created if you execute
  the javadoc ant task ('ant javadoc').
- lib
  Libraries needed in order to compile the application.
  Note: Among other libraries, the directory contains the Axis 2 libraries which
  are required for building the application. At runtime the application will use
  the libraries of the Axis2 and not the libraries in this directory.
- resources
  Global resources, like WSDL web service description file, global Axis2
  configuration file axis2.xml, web service configuration file services.xml, etc.
- src
  Java sources
- test
  Input and output testfiles.
- README.txt
  What you are reading.
- build.properties
  Ant build properties (edit the properties).
- build.xml
  Apache ant build file
