-------------------
Start Tomcat server
-------------------

To start the web server from the root folder use:

mvn tomcat:run

------------
Requirements
------------

* Java 1.6

Web Services
------------

To check supported web services use following URLs from your browser:
1. Services description. Use URL http://localhost:8080/scape-pc-qa-toolwrapper-rest/rest/qualityassurance/
2. Extract features service. Copy file you want to analyze in root directory (for example test.jpg). Then use URL 
http://localhost:8080/scape-pc-qa-toolwrapper-rest/rest/qualityassurance/extractfeatures/test.jpg

-------------------
Taverna integration
-------------------

parameters h1.xml and h2.xml: @Path("/compare/{path1}/{path2}")
http://localhost:8080/scape-pc-qa-toolwrapper-rest/rest/qualityassurance/compare/h1.xml/h2.xml
5. Define HTTP method (GET for example)
6. Define 'Accept' header (text/plane for example)
7. Check that tomcat server is running
8. Run workflow
