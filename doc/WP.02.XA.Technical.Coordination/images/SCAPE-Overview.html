 <area  class="tooltip" title="Characterisation 
is a crucial step 
for digital 
preservation. 
Currently, 
characterisation 
tools are able to 
detect a limited 
number of simple 
technological 
dependencies (file 
formats), 
operating locally 
(on a single 
machine) and at 
small scale. The 
SCAPE architecture 
will enable large 
scale 
characterisation 
if we are able to 
adapt existing 
tools, as well as 
develop new ones 
where necessary, 
to operate 
characterisation 
in a service 
oriented 
architecture and 
to distribute 
processes across a 
cluster of 
servers, on large 
scale collections 
of items

action and

migration tools 
and services have 
been extensively 
analysed and 
employed in 
experimental 
digital 
preservation 
systems. However, 
current approaches 
are not capable of 
coping with real 
size collections. 
This work package 
is focused on the 
applicability of 
such services and 
tools to large 
collections of 
complex digital 
objects in a 
timely manner, by 
focusing on 
analysing and 
improving the 
interfaces and 
internal 
functionality of 
existing 
preservation 
action tools, 
extending and 
creating new large-
scale preservation 
functionality and 
enabling tools to 
deal with not only 
singe file formats 
but also with 
compound objects 
(container objects 
with a set of 
related files in 
different file 
formats)."  id="node63" shape="rect" coords="1478,1536,1726,1563"></area>
 <area  class="tooltip" title="The objective of 
this workpackage 
is to provide 
automated, 
scalable methods 
for quality 
assurance to a 
wide range of 
preservation 
workflows defined 
by the SCAPE 
Testbeds. Until 
now, large-scale 
quality assurance 
has relied on a 
combination of 
human intervention 
and statistical 
methods. In order 
to meet the 
challenges posed 
by very large and 
heterogeneous 
collections, we 
will research and 
develop a novel 
automated quality 
assurance approach 
based on applying 
complex aggregate 
functions that 
capture many 
properties of an 
object combined 
with robust 
comparison 
metrics. We 
hypothesize that 
this approach 
based on analysis 
of disposable 
converted forms 
(not to be 
confused with 
target migrated 
forms) can be 
applied across a 
variety of 
scenarios and 
content, including 
the difficult 
problem of 
evaluating and 
comparing 
emulation 
environments. This 
hypothesis will be 
tested by applying 
the tools to 
preservation 
workflows in each 
of the three SCAPE 
testbeds as part 
of the 
benchmarking and 
validation 
processes."  id="node64" shape="rect" coords="1478,1563,1741,1590"></area>
