tifowa

Tifowa is currently (March 2012) using the Apache Tika™ 1.0 API to extract meta data
from the files contained in a particular folder structure. It creates a list of all
identified MIME types with the total number of occurrences and presents the output
in a format which can be easily imported as CSV data for further processing in a
spreadsheet program.
Embedded in the "scanARC" Taverna workflow, the result is a bunch of files containing
the MIME type distribution list for each ARC file.

By letting the tifowa tool handle the iteration over the files and folders recursively
(extracted from the archive containers), we have been able to avoid the large overhead
of starting the JVM for each file - compared to the Apache Tika™ command line usage
mode in a script.

Usage:
	java -jar tifowa.jar -d [DirectoryToBeScanned] > [OutputFile]
