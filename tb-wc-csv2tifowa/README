csv2Tifowa

The csv2Tifowa tool converts DROID CSV reports into a output format similar to
the output produced by tifowa.
The output of DROID is completely different compared to the output of TIFOWA.
To keep the other parts of a particular Taverna workflow identical to the
TIFOWA version of the workflow, an additional step needs to be performed to
convert the output format. csv2Tifowa can be used to do this.

Usage:
	java -jar csv2Tifowa.jar [DroidCSVFile] > [TifowaCompatibleOutputFile]
